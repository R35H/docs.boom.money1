# The Problem

Bitcoin payments are frustrating.

We love Bitcoin. However, we know that using Bitcoin for small payments is not the best experience.

<!--more-->

### **1. Payments on Bitcoin’s Base Layer are slow and expensive.**

Bitcoin’s Base Layer has fundamental constraints that make Layer 1 Bitcoin payments slow and expensive.

Bitcoin’s 10 minute block times means fast transactions **are not possible.**

Also, Bitcoin’s block size means there is a limit to the number of transactions that can be processed per day.

We don’t believe Bitcoin will be (or should be) changed to make fast payment on the base layer possible.

### 2. Lightning is hard to use.

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is impressive technology with many benefits. We support Lightning, believe it's good for Bitcoin, and we hope builders continue to improve Lightning.

However, we also recognize that the user experience is not ideal.

The main drawbacks:

| Challenge              | Details                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Liquidity Requirements | Users must lock up funds in channels, which might not be immediately intuitive or convenient. |

Users may struggle to find well-funded nodes to route payments through and have difficulty keeping their own channels balanced to facilitate transactions. Rebalancing channels can be time-consuming and costly. |
| Lightning Setup and Onboarding | Setting up a Lightning Network node is a complex and technical process (for most users).

It requires users to manage things like funding channels, rebalancing, and monitoring node status. |
| Channel Management | Managing channels for optimal performance and costs requires active maintenance. |
| Network Capacity Limits | The Lightning Network can face capacity issues, limiting the size of payments that can be efficiently processed. |
| Unreliable and slow performance | The Lightning Network is unreliable. Slow channel opening/closing times, nodes going offline causing disruptions, and difficulties with routing payments successfully, undermines the promised speed and efficiency of the Lightning Network. |
| Interoperability | Compatibility between different Lightning implementations can be an issue, affecting payments and network growth. |
| The Need to Be Online | Users need to be online to receive payments |
| Default Custodial | Lightning companies default to custodial wallets |
| Capital Inefficient | Lightning channels lock Bitcoin that cannot be used. |

These challenges mean Lightning is not the perfect option for Bitcoin payments.

At Boom, we’re building a solution to improve the Bitcoin payments experience.
