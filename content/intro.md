# Intro to Boom Wallet

## The problem

Bitcoin payments are frustrating. We love Bitcoin. However, we know that using Bitcoin for small payments is not the best experience.

### Payments on Bitcoin’s base layer are slow and expensive

Bitcoin’s Base Layer has fundamental constraints that make Layer 1 Bitcoin payments slow and expensive. Bitcoin’s 10 minute block times means fast transactions **are not possible.**

Also, Bitcoin’s block size means there is a limit to the number of transactions that can be processed per day. We don’t believe Bitcoin will be (or should be) changed to make fast payment on the base layer possible.

### Lightning trade-offs

Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is impressive technology with many benefits. Lightning was the right solution at the right time, and we hope builders continue to improve Lightning.

However, we also recognize that the trade-offs required to make the user experience acceptable, are themselves unacceptable.

In order to use lightning in a non-custodial way, users must:

- run their own lightning node server
- run their own bitcoin node server
- open and manage liquidity channels
- optionally, but recommended, run a watch tower

Even after making this choice, opening liquidity channels is a capital inefficent and risky undertaking. Watch towers may reduce risk but add more complexity to the process.

So most lightning wallets default to a custodial implementation, giving up key principles of:

- not your keys, not your coins
- trust minimization
- decentralization

## The solution

Compare this to the Stacks Bitcoin layer 2 wallet:

- non-custodial
- trust minimized
- decentralized

With the coming Nakamoto hard-fork implementation, and the introduction of sBTC (Q4), Boom Wallet will be able to provide fast transactions and low fees with a 1:1 Bitcoin pegged token.

Boom's focus on payments and payment infrastructure makes the dream of a decentralized Bitcoin economy a reality.
